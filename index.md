<div class="intro-text">
<p>Thank you for visiting. I am a development economist and applied microeconometrician with a focus on health and social security in China.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), [University of Groningen], The Netherlands. Previously, I obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] in the Netherlands and a research master's degree from the University of Groningen.</p>
</div>
<!-- I apply causal inference; "applied microeconometrician" for job applications
could add orcid in the future -->

<div class="section-header">
  <h2>Research Focus</h2>
</div>

<div class="focus-content">
<p class="focus-intro">My research lies at the intersection of <strong>health economics</strong>, <strong>labor economics</strong>, and <strong>public economics</strong>. I specialize in applying causal inference methods to understand complex health and social policy questions.</p>

<div class="focus-section">
  <h3 class="focus-title">Primary Research Areas</h3>
  <ul class="compact-list">
    <li>Elderly health, cognition, and mental health</li>
    <li>Health inequalities and socioeconomic determinants</li>
    <li>Social security systems and pension programs</li>
    <li>Informal care and long-term care economics</li>
    <li>Multimorbidity and disease progression</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="focus-section">
  <h3 class="focus-title">Methodological Approach</h3>
  <p class="method-text">I employ advanced econometric techniques including difference-in-differences, finite mixture models, and duration analysis to address questions of unobserved heterogeneity and causal inference in health outcomes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<!-- In my current research I study the presence of unobserved heterogeneity in health, and how informal care replaces more expensive formal alternatives. -->
<!-- I am an applied microeconometrician who works on the economics of aging, particularly the intersection of health, saving behavior, and social insurance. In my job market paper, I examine the determinants of long-term care use, including informal care provision, the need for care, and economic resources.
Need to add more on money/insurance/costs/
