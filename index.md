Thank you for visiting my page! I am a development economist and applied microeconometrician with a focus on health and social security in China. 

Currently, I am a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), [University of Groningen], The Netherlands. Previously, I obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] in the Netherlands and a research master's degree from the University of Groningen.
<!-- I apply causal inference; "applied microeconometrician" for job applications
could add orcid in the future -->

## Research Focus

My research lies at the intersection of **health economics**, **labor economics**, and **public economics**. I specialize in applying causal inference methods to understand complex health and social policy questions.

**Primary Research Areas:**
- Elderly health, cognition, and mental health
- Health inequalities and socioeconomic determinants
- Social security systems and pension programs
- Informal care and long-term care economics
- Multimorbidity and disease progression

**Methodological Approach:**  
I employ advanced econometric techniques including difference-in-differences, finite mixture models, and duration analysis to address questions of unobserved heterogeneity and causal inference in health outcomes.

<!-- In my current research I study the presence of unobserved heterogeneity in health, and how informal care replaces more expensive formal alternatives. -->
<!-- I am an applied microeconometrician who works on the economics of aging, particularly the intersection of health, saving behavior, and social insurance. In my job market paper, I examine the determinants of long-term care use, including informal care provision, the need for care, and economic resources.
