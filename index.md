Hi! I am a PhD student in Economics at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), [University of Groningen] in the Netherlands. Previously, I obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] and a research master's degree from the University of Groningen.

## Research Focus

My research interests primarily lie in health economics, labor economics, and behavioral economics. 
In my academic work, I have primarily used difference-in-differences methodologies, finite mixture models, and duration models. I have investigated causal questions related to fertility choices, elderly health, and other long-term outcomes over the life-cycle.

Next to my research interests in economic research, I have a strong interest for mechanism design and Natural Language Processing.
