Thank you for visiting my page! I am a development economist and applied microeconometrician with a focus on health and social security in China. 

Currently, I am a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), [University of Groningen], The Netherlands. Previously, I have obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] in the Netherlands and a research master degree from the University of Groningen. 
<!-- I apply causal inference; "applied microeconometrician" for job applications
could add orcid in the future -->

My main research areas are health economics, labor economics, and public economics. 
My main research topics are related to elderly health, particularly cognition and mental health, and addressing socioeconomic differences early in life to reduce health inequalities in later adulthood.

<!-- In my current research I study the presence of unobserved heterogeneity in health, and how informal care replaces more expensive formal alternatives. -->
<!-- I am an applied microeconometrician who works on the economics of aging, particularly the intersection of health, saving behavior, and social insurance. In my job market paper, I examine the determinants of long-term care use, including informal care provision, the need for care, and economic resources.
Need to add more on money/insurance/costs/
