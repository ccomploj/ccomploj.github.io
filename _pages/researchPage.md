My research primarily examines behavioral and health responses to public policies. I previously used retirement data from China, the US and Europe to estimate my models. I employ microeconometrics methods and causal inference, and am proficient in Stata, Python, R and LaTeX.

## Working Papers

### Noncontributory Pensions and Mental Health: Evidence from Rural China
*joint with [Stefan Pichler] and [Gerard van den Berg]*

<summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper investigates the mental health consequences of noncontributory pensions by leveraging regional and temporal variation in implementation dates of the New Rural Pension Scheme (2009–2012). Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we implement a difference-in-differences strategy and compare estimates from a two-way fixed effect specification with estimators that are robust to heterogeneous treatment effects. We estimate an effect of 60% on pension take-up among the eligible rural population, a 900-yuan rise in annual pension income, and significant crowding-out of private transfers from children and grandchildren. The results indicate that the new rural pension scheme improves mental health by reducing depressive symptoms, and provide evidence of its broader welfare implications.

### Multimorbidity in SHARE and ELSA

<summary>Abstract</summary>

It is well established that multimorbidity increases with aging and is associated with adverse health outcomes, including physical and cognitive disability, frailty, and mortality. Using longitudinal data from more than 25,000 participants in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we describe the longitudinal disease trajectories of elderly individuals older than 50 prior to death.

We implement a linear mixed model and a generalized ordered logit with flexible coefficients across thresholds and find that the probability within individuals of developing higher-order diseases increases dynamically with the current disease count. Heterogeneity analyses suggest that individuals who experienced the first disease onset at older ages present more rapid health deterioration, and that individuals from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds accumulate chronic conditions faster. We do not find evidence of any chronic disease clusters.

### Duration Dependence in Multimorbidity Accumulation: Health Types and Health Inequality
*Solo-authored*

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Multimorbidity (having more than one chronic health condition at the same time) increases with aging and is associated with adverse health outcomes, including physical and cognitive disability, frailty, and early death. This paper studies how unobserved differences between individuals (i.e., health "types") account for differences in the speed of disease accumulation between individuals who are indistinguishable using observed characteristics.

Using rich panel data with health and labor market histories from more than 20,000 individuals followed over a period of 20 years from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we model the transitions between different disease states, or multimorbidity states, using a finite mixture ordered logit that incorporates unobserved heterogeneity. The model exploits the duration spent in each multimorbidity state to identify the presence of multiple health types among the elderly.

### Does it Pay to Join the Party? Decomposing the Communist Party Wage Premium in China
*Solo-authored | Pre-doctoral work*

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

In the Chinese labor market, Communist Party members have better-paying jobs and are more likely to work in white-collar occupations, but it is difficult to disentangle the party membership effect from the effect coming from unobserved differences in ability. In this paper, I match similar party and non-party members based on their propensity to attain membership using self-reported information about childhood socioeconomic conditions and parental background, which are highly predictive of membership status.

Using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2018, I find that after conditioning on childhood conditions, the lifetime income differences between party and non-party members decrease substantially, though the party premium effect persists. The residual premium is largest for retirees who previously worked in white-collar occupations, while no residual premium persists in blue-collar occupations or those still employed at the time of the survey.
