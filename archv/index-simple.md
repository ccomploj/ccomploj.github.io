Thank you for visiting. I am a development economist and applied microeconometrician with a focus on health and social security in China.

Currently, I am a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB), [University of Groningen], The Netherlands. Previously, I obtained an undergraduate degree in Economics from [Maastricht University] in the Netherlands and a research master's degree from the University of Groningen.

## Research Focus

My research lies at the intersection of **health economics**, **labor economics**, and **public economics**. I specialize in applying causal inference methods to understand complex health and social policy questions.

### Primary Research Areas

- Elderly health, cognition, and mental health
- Health inequalities and socioeconomic determinants
- Social security systems and pension programs
- Informal care and long-term care economics
- Multimorbidity and disease progression

### Methodological Approach

I employ advanced econometric techniques including difference-in-differences, finite mixture models, and duration analysis to address questions of unobserved heterogeneity and causal inference in health outcomes.
